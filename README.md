awesome-config
==============

These are my configuration files for the awesome window manager (awesomewm).
It is written for version > 3.5.

For now it is an import of a config working on a 1yr old Gentoo Linux
installation. I will test and debug soonish :)
Theoretically the config should work for both FreeBSD and Linux.

It is still work in progress but feel free to use it.
Bug reports / patches are wellcome ;)
