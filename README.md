awesome-config
==============

These are my configuration files for the awesome window manager (awesomewm).
It is still work in progress but feel free to use it.

The config should work for both FreeBSD and Linux but I haven't tested it on Linux yet.
For FreeBSD you will will need to install the port 'devel/lua-sysctl' in order to use the wibox at the bottom and the port 'audio/aumix' in order to use the mute functionality.
